        <h1>My Father</h1>
        <p>There was a time when many
            authorities discounted the role of
            fathers in families. They believed
            that fathers were merely a biological necessity. As a result, researchers primarily studied mothers and
            their children.
            Recently, scientists have discovered fathers. Researchers learned
            that fathers were not “optional
            family baggage.” Studies show the
            importance of a caring father in the
            life of a child, boy or girl.
            Why Fathers?
            Much has been said recently
            about fathers and fatherhood, even
            in the political arena. In his 1992
            presidential nomination acceptance
            speech, then-governor Bill Clinton
            gave a terse warning to fathers
            who fail to meet their child support
            obligations: “We will find you.” In
            his book Standing Firm, former vice
            president Dan Quayle wrote, “A
            society that promotes the idea that
            a father’s role is irrelevant breeds
            irresponsibility.” Vice President
            Al Gore held a White House conference to launch the nationwide
            “Father to Father” movement. Organizations such as the National
            Fatherhood Initiative and The
            Fatherhood Project have spurred
            community-based programs in
            father involvement.
            Concern about fatherhood is not
            new. People worried about the
            absence of fathers in the 1880s
            when men went in massive numbers from farm to factory. Similar
            concerns were voiced during the
            1930s when the Great Depression
            left millions of men unemployed,
            dependent on bread lines. However, the current focus on the importance of fatherhood is supported
            by research, especially over the
            last three decades, that points out
            the critical importance of a father’s
            involvement with his children.
            Trends in Father
            Involvement
            There are two major trends in
            American fatherhood today: father
            absence and father involvement.
            A large and increasing number
            of children are being raised without the continued presence of a
            father. Fatherhood historian Robert
            L. Griswold, notes that while the
            number of American families since
            1970 has risen 20 percent, the
            number of mother-only families
            has increased by 51 percent.
